# About This Project

This is my personal recreation of the LSTR main menu eye from Signalis. I built it using only plain JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas because I wanted to see if I could capture that quiet feeling the original has — the way it stares back, calm but unsettling. 

Signalis means a lot to me. Its atmosphere, its pacing, the way it handles silence — it all feels deliberate and human. Recreating this wasn’t about coding something impressive; it was about understanding the rhythm and subtlety behind that design.

I learned a lot while making this. Mostly JavaScript —  by Recreating this i've learned alot from technical standpoint and from aesthetic way too, studying how to lay a motion layer by layer to achive that somewhat resembles the original menu. It reminded me how much thought goes into the smallest details of games like this.

i am using no framework, — just a JavaScript and HTML Canvas. my attempt to bring that moment where you make LSTR stare at you pointer in the simplest way I could.

This project was made out of love and respect for Signalis and its creators. All original credit for the design and inspiration belongs entirely to them.

You can try it by clone this Repository or Downloads the source and run ```index.html``` in your browser. Also you can use this as live Wallpaper, all you have to do is add new wallpaper in Lively Wallpaper and use index.html as the file used as wallpaper. 

Also probably won't work in resolution higher than 1980x1080, it's because the scaling issue. thou i want to fix it, i can't at the moment i think this already good enough for my wallpaper hahaha.

there you go, enjoy. :3
