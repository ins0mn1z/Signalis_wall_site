About This Project

This is my personal recreation of the LSTR main menu eye from Signalis. I built it using only plain JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas because I wanted to see if I could capture that quiet, eerie feeling the original has — the way it stares back, calm but unsettling.

Signalis means a lot to me. Its atmosphere, its pacing, the way it handles silence — it all feels deliberate and human. Recreating the eye wasn’t about coding something impressive; it was about understanding the rhythm and subtlety behind that design.

I learned a lot while making this. Mostly patience — breaking the animation down frame by frame, studying how motion and stillness balance each other. It reminded me how much thought goes into the smallest details of games like this.

There’s no framework, no engine, nothing extra — just a canvas, some code, and time. my attempt to bring that moment back to life in the simplest way I could.

This project was made out of love and respect for Signalis and its creators. All original credit for the design and inspiration belongs entirely to them.
